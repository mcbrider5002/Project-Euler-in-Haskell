There are fast fibonaccis for problem 2...

I can still write better algorithms for problem 3...

There's a formula for problem 6...

For problem 8 it is possible to establish ordering on two adjacent sequences by their first and last digit... Can I utilise this somehow?

Can I write an efficient prime factorisation algorithm which I can then use in e.g. problems 3 and 5?
